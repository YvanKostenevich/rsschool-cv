### Summary  


As a strong team player who thrives under pressure
and always  looking to learn something new, I view
the Web-development career path as a perfect option
for me to take.
My goal is to strength theoretical knowledge
and get practical experience in Front-end
Development that will allow me to secure
a position of a junior software developer.
